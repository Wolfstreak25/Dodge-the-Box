# Dodge-the-Box
This is a hyper casual platform game made for PC and Web such that it's WebGL version could be accessed from the mobile device as well. I have uploaded a playable demo of this project on my [itch.io](https://wolfstreak.itch.io/dodge-the-box)
# Featured
The main goal of the project was to work on a 3D project and to understand and use the different thing YUnity can offer. Such as
1. Unity Object Pool
2. 3D character movement and animations
3. Cinema Machine
4. New Input System
5. Universal Render Pipeline
6. Unity Physics and colliders etc.

# Things to be improved
There ane many things that could be improved in this project such as 
1. use of Observer pattern for enabling or pausing the game instead of spawner or player script
2. Change in scoring system instread of time based it could be different
3. Destroy mechanism
and so on...
